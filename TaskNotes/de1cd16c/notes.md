## Notes
Started after implementing B9B7F026 due to adding HollowCount.

That said, the dots aren’t “hollows” in the sense I was intending them to be, because they aren’t the color of the background. But because it’s using the FormMultiColorCompositeObjects mode, it doesn’t form composite objects, and so the locations of the pixels really do become “hollows”. So this is a bit odd, but we’ll go with it for now.
