## Notes
My rule finder is using FilledArea.Rank to choose which object to keep, but I think the task author is intending the shape that is unique to be kept.

This implies that it would be appropriate to add a new property, SceneShapeCount, to specify how many objects in the scene have this objectâ€™s shape.
