## Notes

### Finding Rules


#### Scene Parsing

We parse the input and output scenes into objects.


#### Mapping Input Objects to Output Objects

For all but one input object, there is only one object in the output scene with a matching position and  shape, while one object is always deleted, making it straightforward to produce a mapping from input objects to output objects.

e.g.


![image 1](image1.png?raw=true)


#### Finding Rules from Object Mappings

* We can find rules by grouping objects by color.
* When we do this, we notice that:
   * All light blue objects are replaced by another image.
       * However, the replacement image varies by example.
       * We notice that the replacement image is always the image of the non-light-blue object.
   * All objects that arenâ€™t light blue are deleted.
