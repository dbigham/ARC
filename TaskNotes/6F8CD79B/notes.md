## Notes

### Finding Rules


#### Scene Parsing

We parse the input and output scenes into objects.


#### Mapping Input Objects to Output Objects

Since there are no input objects, there is no “mapping” to be made, except for noticing that for each example one object is added.

e.g.



![image 1](image1.png?raw=true)


#### Finding Rules from Object Mappings

We generalize the added object in each example into a single rule.



![image 2](image2.png?raw=true)
