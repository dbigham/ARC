## Notes
This example introduces the concept of sub-dividing a problem based on a grid that is present in both the input and output.

For example, we take the input cells at {1, 1} for all examples and try to find rules that can produce the output cells at {1, 1} for all examples. If we are able to find a rule set for each cell location, we thus have a way to map entire input scenes to their corresponding output scenes.
