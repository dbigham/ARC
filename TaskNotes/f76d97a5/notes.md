## Notes
Ideally we’d like to be able to reference the “non-gray color”, but currently there isn’t any single referenceable object with only that color.

For this example, we introduce “referenceable classes”, such as “the non-gray objects”, so that we can infer what color the gray object should become as “the color of the non-gray objects”.
