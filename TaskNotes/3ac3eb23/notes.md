## Notes

### Finding Rules


#### Scene Parsing

We parse the input and output scenes into objects.


#### Mapping Input Objects to Output Objects

For each input object, there is only one object in the output scene that it is contained within, making it straightforward to produce a mapping from input objects to output objects.

e.g.


![image 1](image1.png?raw=true)


#### Finding Rules from Object Mappings

All object mappings involve replacing the input objectâ€™s shape with a common output shape, making it straightforward to produce the single required rule:


![image 2](image2.png?raw=true)
