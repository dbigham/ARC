## Notes
This example started working after implementing 178fcbfb-easier.

But as of Aug 26 2022, this is basically passing “by accident” since the rule set is awful and definitely not properly generalized.

I think what we need to do here is to have a scene parsing mode where it considers not follow diagonals when deciding how large an image should be.
