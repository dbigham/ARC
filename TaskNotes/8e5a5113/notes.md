## Notes
* We notice there are two vertical lines that span the entire height of the input, so we are sure to segment those on their own such that they arenâ€™t included as part of the object on the left.
* We notice that the objects in the input scene always occur unchanged in the output, but there are always two additional objects added.
* When producing a rule for the two added objects, we notice that:
   * The first added object is always a 90 degree rotation of the non-gray object from the input.
   * The second added object is always a 180 degree rotation of the non-gray object from the input.
