## Notes
Started passing when I implemented 746b3537.

I was astonished to see this input working -- I had looked at it recently and wasn’t sure how I’d approach this, the challenge being the doubly-wide parts of the input. What I didn’t realize, but the code found, is that X2 can be set to the input object’s X2.InverseRank. I’m not sure if that’s fully robust, but it works for these examples.
